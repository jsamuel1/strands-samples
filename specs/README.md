# Design Specifications

This directory contains design specifications created by the Design Agent for approved GitHub issues.

## File Naming Convention

Specifications are named using the pattern: `{issue-number}-{issue-title}.md`

Example: `123-add-user-authentication.md`

## Specification Structure

Each specification should include:

1. **Problem Statement** - Clear description of the issue being addressed
2. **Requirements Analysis** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Proposed Solution** - High-level solution approach
4. **Technical Architecture** - Detailed technical design
5. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step implementation approach
6. **Security Considerations** - Security requirements and measures
7. **Testing Strategy** - Testing approach and coverage
8. **Risk Assessment** - Potential risks and mitigation strategies
9. **Resource Requirements** - Time, personnel, and infrastructure needs
10. **Acceptance Criteria** - Definition of done

## Review Process

1. Design Agent creates specification based on GitHub issue
2. Design Review Agent reviews the specification for completeness and quality
3. Once approved, Implementation Agent uses the specification to create code
4. Code Review Agent ensures implementation matches the specification

## Templates

See the `templates/` directory for specification templates for different types of issues:
