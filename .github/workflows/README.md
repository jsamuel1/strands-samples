## Configuration

### GitHub Project Board Setup (Automatic Configuration)

**üöÄ The orchestration agent automatically sets up and configures your GitHub Project board:**

#### Automatic Setup Process:

1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Analyzes contributor count and activity patterns
   - Calculates issue velocity and PR frequency
   - Determines optimal team size classification
   - Assesses current workflow bottlenecks

2. **Intelligent Project Board Creation**
   - Creates project board with optimal column structure
   - Calculates WIP limits based on team size and activity
   - Configures custom fields for priority, effort, and type tracking
   - Sets up automations for seamless workflow integration

3. **Smart WIP Limit Calculation**
   - **Backlog**: `team_size √ó 3 + 4` (scales with team size)
   - **Design**: `max(1, team_size √∑ 3)` (roughly 1 designer per 3 developers)
   - **Implementation**: `max(2, team_size √∑ 2)` (half the team can implement simultaneously)
   - **Review**: `max(2, team_size √∑ 3)` (review capacity based on team size)
   - **Done**: Unlimited

4. **Automated Project Board Optimizations**
   - Continuously monitors flow metrics
   - Adjusts WIP limits based on actual performance
   - Updates automations to improve workflow efficiency
   - Adds missing custom fields and configurations

#### Manual Setup Triggers:

```bash
# Force project board setup/optimization
gh workflow run 00-orchestration-agent.yml -f setup_project_board=true

# Setup with specific team size
gh workflow run 00-orchestration-agent.yml -f setup_project_board=true -f team_size="medium (4-8)"

# Auto-calculate WIP limits based on repository analysis
gh workflow run 00-orchestration-agent.yml -f wip_limit=auto
```

#### Project Board Features Automatically Configured:

- **üìã Backlog Column**: Issues ready for design work
- **üé® Design Column**: Issues being designed or awaiting approval  
- **üî® Implementation Column**: Approved designs being implemented
- **üîç Review Column**: Completed implementations under review
- **‚úÖ Done Column**: Completed and merged work

- **Custom Fields**:
  - Priority (üö® Urgent, ‚ö° High, üìã Normal, üìù Low)
  - Effort (Story points or hours)
  - Type (‚ú® Feature, üêõ Bug, üîß Enhancement, üßπ Chore)
  - Sprint (Current sprint identifier)

- **Smart Automations**:
  - Auto-add new issues to Backlog
  - Auto-move items based on PR status
  - Auto-assign based on column and expertise
  - Stale item detection and alerts

### Project Configuration (.github/project-config.yml)
Provides fallback settings and automation rules when project board is not available.

### Manual Triggers
All agents can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch:

```bash
# Trigger design for specific issue
gh workflow run 01-design-agent.yml -f issue_number=123 -f priority=high

# Trigger implementation for approved design
gh workflow run 03-implementation-agent.yml -f spec_file=specs/123-feature.md -f issue_number=123

# Trigger code review for PR
gh workflow run 04-code-review-agent.yml -f pr_number=456 -f review_focus=security
```

### Orchestration Controls
The orchestration agent supports several control parameters:

- **Auto WIP Limits**: Automatically calculate optimal WIP limits based on repository analysis
- **Project Board Setup**: Force creation or optimization of project board configuration
- **Team Size Override**: Specify team size for more accurate WIP limit calculation
- **Urgent Mode**: Bypass project board WIP limits for critical work
- **Focus Stage**: Prioritize specific project board columns

### Advanced Configuration Options

```bash
# Complete project board setup with team size specification
gh workflow run 00-orchestration-agent.yml \
  -f setup_project_board=true \
  -f team_size="large (9+)" \
  -f wip_limit=auto

# Optimize existing project board
gh workflow run 00-orchestration-agent.yml \
  -f setup_project_board=true

# Emergency mode with bypassed limits
gh workflow run 00-orchestration-agent.yml \
  -f urgent_mode=true \
  -f focus_stage=implementation
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

The orchestration agent tracks key metrics using **GitHub Project board data**:

- **Cycle Time**: Time from backlog to completion (tracked via project board card movement)
- **Lead Time**: Time from design to implementation (tracked via project board column transitions)
- **Throughput**: Completion rate (tracked via project board done column)
- **WIP Efficiency**: Utilization of project board column capacity
- **Flow Efficiency**: Time spent in active work vs waiting (project board analytics)

### Project Board Analytics Integration

The system provides enhanced metrics by integrating with GitHub Project board data:

- **Column Utilization**: How full each project board column is relative to its WIP limit
- **Flow Rate**: Items moving through project board columns per time period
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Columns that consistently hit WIP limits
- **Starvation Alerts**: Empty columns that should have work flowing to them
- **Capacity Planning**: Recommendations for adjusting project board WIP limits

## Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Clear Issue Descriptions**: Provide detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Project Board Usage**: Add issues to the project board for automatic management
3. **Priority Setting**: Mark urgent items appropriately (use priority indicators in project board)
4. **Feedback Loop**: Respond to agent comments and reviews promptly

### For Maintainers
1. **Automatic Setup**: Let the orchestration agent create and configure the project board automatically
2. **Monitor Flow**: Check orchestration agent reports and project board analytics regularly
3. **Trust the Algorithm**: The agent continuously optimizes WIP limits based on actual performance
4. **Review Metrics**: Analyze cycle time and throughput trends from project board data
5. **Handle Escalations**: Address bottlenecks and urgent items quickly
6. **Customize as Needed**: Override automatic settings when specific business needs require it

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WIP Limits Exceeded**
   - Check project board column capacity and current item count
   - Consider temporarily increasing project board WIP limits
   - Focus on completing current work before starting new

2. **Project Board Setup Issues**
   - Run orchestration agent with `setup_project_board=true` to force reconfiguration
   - Check repository permissions for project board creation and management
   - Verify GitHub token has necessary scopes for project board operations
   - Review orchestration agent logs for specific setup errors

3. **Stage Starvation**
   - Ensure upstream project board columns have work ready
   - Check for blocking dependencies in project board
   - Consider prioritizing upstream work

4. **Agent Failures**
   - Check workflow logs for error details
   - Verify AWS credentials and permissions
   - Retry failed workflows manually if needed

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Urgent Work**: Use urgent mode to bypass project board WIP limits
2. **Project Board Issues**: Agent automatically recreates or fixes project board configuration
3. **System Issues**: Disable orchestration and run agents manually
4. **Capacity Changes**: Agent automatically adjusts WIP limits based on team changes

## Security & Permissions

All workflows require:
- `contents: write` - For creating files and commits
- `issues: write` - For managing issues and labels
- `pull-requests: write` - For creating and managing PRs
- `actions: write` - For triggering other workflows

AWS credentials are required for Bedrock model access via OIDC role assumption.

## Future Enhancements
